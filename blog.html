                This is my first web 3 event. I attended the Solana Developers India Tour and learned a lot about Solana and Blockchain using the basics of JavaScript and Rust. This event is the most interesting event of my life because it was the first tech event I've ever attended. Our speaker, Ayush Chouhan, spoke a lot about blockchain development and Solana. Basically, Solana is a blockchain platform that uses a proof-of-stake mechanism to provide smart contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL. Solana was launched in 2020 by Solana Labs, which was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal in 2018. In June 2021, Solana Labs sold $314 million worth of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, to a group of funds led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital</p>

                I wanted to share my excitement about attending a Node.js workshop where I learned to connect frontend and backend using MongoDB. The workshop covered Node.js fundamentals, Express.js for backend setup, and seamless integration with MongoDB. I gained hands-on experience in creating APIs, managing data with MongoDB, and ensuring real-time interaction. This knowledge has equipped me to build dynamic applications that bridge frontend and backend seamlessly. I'm eager to apply these skills and explore further possibilities. Looking forward to discussing more in detail.</p>
